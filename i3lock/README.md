# README

Fork of the popular [i3lock screen saver](https://github.com/i3/i3lock).
I've changed it up so whenever a key press occurs, a camera shot is taken and the taken picture is used as a lock screen wallpaper.

This is an awesome way to leave your workstation seemingly unlocked and when someone tries to mess with it, they will be caught in their tracks.

# TODO:
Will be adding debian dependencies soon since documentation is not very clear on that part.
